## Hgraph's AI Query Assistants

We currently offer the following tool to the public:

**[Hgraph GQL Assistant](https://docs.hgraph.com/graphql-assistant)**:
- Designed to help developers and analysts build and troubleshoot GraphQL queries for accessing Hedera Mirror Node data.
- Queries are utilized with our GraphQL API and in the playground in our account dashboard.
- Initially, [offered as a Custom GPT](https://hgraph.com/assistant/gql), the GQL assistant aims to solve immediate customer painpoints (creating queries for the first time).
- Future plans for deeper integrations, hardware optimizations and more powerful, open source models.

Additionally, we have internal tools:

**Hgraph SQL Assistant**:
- Used for crafting and troubleshooting SQL queries.
- Internal use (and available to enterprise).

**Hgraph GQL Super Assistant**:
- Includes all the capabilities of the GQL query assistant.
- Has the ability to call the Hgraph API directly.
- Can deliver human readable data and visualizations.
- Internal testing only.
